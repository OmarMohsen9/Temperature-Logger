# Temperature-Logger
This project uses AVR MC, LM35 Temperature sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth module, 16x2 LCD, DS1307 RTC, push button and a buzzer

-	Integrated LCD for providing a user interface for checking the readings in Celsius (°C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (°F), selectable through a button interface.
-	Implemented an alarm system triggering a buzzer when temperature falls below a certain-defined threshold.
-	Utilized Real-Time Clock (RTC) module to accurately timestamp temperature data, alongside date and time information.
-	Utilizing USART to send log data through Bluetooth (BT) module to transmit temperature data upon request.
